# React Project
Welcome to the React project! This README file will guide you on how to run the project locally after downloading the folder from GitHub.
## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following softwares installed on your local system:
- Node.js (version 10 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
## Getting Started
To run the React project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the project folder from GitHub.
        `https://github.com/manish-techis/React-Component-Lifecycle.git`
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
        `cd React-Lifecycle`
3. Install project dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or if you are using yarn:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
4. Once the dependencies are installed successfully, start the development server by running the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
   or if you are using yarn:
    ```
    yarn start
    ```
5. Your default browser should automatically open and load the project at http://localhost:3000. If it doesnâ€™t, manually open your browser and go to that URL.
6. You should now see the React project up and running locally! Any changes you make to the source code will automatically refresh the page in the browser.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
